# Truck Stop
Truck Stop is a web-based app from Convoy that helps truck drivers keep track of their jobs, each of which has a set of stops, each of which has a set of tasks. 
Drivers may mark tasks completed. A Stop is complete when all its tasks have been marked complete. A job is complete when all of its stops are complete. These changes are persistant across app loads.
